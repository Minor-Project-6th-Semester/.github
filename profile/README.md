<h1 align="center" > Remaining Useful Life Prediction </h1>
<h3 align="center">The need for society to investigate and create new energy is acute due to the advent of the conventional energy crisis. Lithium-ion batteries, among other novel energy sources, have emerged as the industry leader due to their high energy density, high output voltage, extended cycle life, and broad operating temperature range. Nevertheless, as lithium-ion batteries undergo repeated cycles of charging and discharging, the internal resistance rises. The battery overheats as internal resistance rises, which continues to impair battery pack performance and regular use. The number of charging and discharging cycles that remain between the start of the measurement and the end of life (EOL) of lithium-ion batteries is known as the remaining usable life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries.</h2>
